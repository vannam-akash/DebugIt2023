# Project Idea: Lost and Found Management System

The Lost and Found Management System is a web-based platform that aims to streamline the process of reporting lost items, searching for lost items, and claiming ownership of found items for aiding the students of IIT BHU to retrieve thier lost items. The system will enable students and faculty members of our college to easily report lost items, search for lost items, and claim the ownership of found items.

The website will enable students and faculty members to report unreported lost items found on campus, categorized into various types. To report a lost item, the finder will provide details such as the date, time, and place of the discovery, along with a brief description of the item that doesn't give away specific details.
Owners of lost items can search for their belongings on the website by selecting the relevant category. They can claim ownership by providing their contact details (Email ID and Phone Number), Roll Number, and a proper description of the item, including proof of ownership. The finder of the lost item will review the claim and rectify the ownership accordingly. Once the lost item is returned to its owner, the finder will have the option to resolve or delete the report.

The website aims to provide a reliable and efficient system for managing lost items on campus. By allowing students and faculty members to report found items, it increases the chances of owners reclaiming their belongings. The categorization of items also makes it easier for owners to search for their lost items, while also allowing them to claim their lost items in a hassle-free manner. Overall, the Lost and Found website will enhance the campus community's experience by reducing the stress of losing valuable belongings.
